              <p>
				  Our team consists of 5 dedicated seniors from Cupertino High School. Each one of us contributes to a distinct role for our project, these being Community Outreach, Historian, Public Opinions, Marketing and Financial Advisor. Together, we are able to put together a cohesive effort towards change in our school district's curriculum.

              <p>In order to make the school curriculum directly applicable to the skills that are used in everyday life, we hope to add financial literacy classes to our school’s curriculum. These classes will help students discover and understand the technicalities of many future responsibilities such as managing money and filing for taxes. In learning these topics, students will have a fresh head start to their lives as adults, and as a result, are less inclined to making detrimental financial choices.  </p>

              <p>According to a survey put out by the Center for Financial Literacy at Champlain College, Virginia, Utah, Missouri, Tennessee and Alabama where all states that scored an A on teaching financial literacy. Utah in particular was the only state to score an A+. This is because Utah has a structured set of guidelines to meet in order for students to graduate. These include a mandatory half year course in a financial topic along with an end of the year course assessment examination designed by the state administration. 
In comparison to these states, California scored a miserably low F. This is because California has no financial literacy requirements in order for students to graduate. As part of our mission we hope to amend this issue, at least at a local level. If it was possible in some of the states mentioned earlier, it is most definitely possible in California. </p>

              <p>In order to understand how this issue affects the students in our local school district, we put out a survey of our own asking students various questions regarding financial literacy. From our survey we discovered that 71% of participants worry that they do not acquire the proper life skills they need in high school, 78% of participants frequently ask their parents and other peers in order to find out basic information about finance and 88% of participants think that highschool is too focused on college readiness and not life readiness. Here are some passionate quotes we received from a few participants:
<br><br>
“I know nothing about the real world. I spend stupid amounts of hours memorizing stuff just to get an A. Then after the test, we forget everything about the unit. Schools should teach us life skills. Most of us will never use calculus in the real world.”  - anonymous
<br><br>
“I wish there was a personal finance class in highschool because I'm in my freshman year of college and I have no idea what I'm doing right now.” - anonymous
<br><br>
“I think high school curriculums should change because society is changing, and we must thus adapt.” - anonymous 
<br><br>
We were unable to disclose names due to privacy concerns.

              <h2 class="display-4">The Process</h2>
              <p>Adding classes to the school curriculum is a lengthy process. It begins with a Preliminary Course Proposal Form that must be submitted to the district office with the signature of the initiating school’s principal. This form should include any data that shows that such additions to the curriculum are beneficiary along with budgeting guidelines that include the costs of starting and maintaining such a class. Once submitted, this form goes to the Curriculum Liaison Group, who review the form and contemplate potential advantages and disadvantages of the plan. For further review, the form is then sent to the Curriculum and Guidance Council. With all the feedback received, the superintendent will then refer the form to the board of trustees, where it awaits approval. If approved, the form will be used to create a UC course submission template, which unfortunately must go back to the Board of Trustees for approval. If the proposed course makes it past all these obstacles, then it is officially added to the course catalog. For any interested here is our district’s <a href = "https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1536604919/fuhsdorg/yvysndb3ajrezghxth44/PrelimaryCourseProposalForm.pdf">Preliminary Course Proposal Form.</a></p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Budgetary Guidelines</h2>
              <p>With Governor Brown increasing the school budget in California by 5.2%, it is a great time to start adding classes to the curriculum. Along with this, organization such, as the Center for Education Reform and the National Education Association, can be of financial aid when getting our proposal off the ground. As far as actual costs go, financial literacy classes are not by any means pricy. The one semester length of the class combined with its undemanding staff and resource requirements make the class extremely cost efficient to run. The material cost of the class are largely composed by the cost of the textbook, <a href="https://www.valorebooks.com/textbooks/nnn/9781631261374?utm_source=Froogle&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Froogle&date=10/16/18&gclid=CjwKCAjwmJbeBRBCEiwAAY4VVcxIUW4QmdoUGemB8RjcIuMiL0Mr9UIzY8ZGpgdL84hlj4su_6IB2hoCV-gQAvD_BwE">Foundations of Financial Literacy</a>. </p>
